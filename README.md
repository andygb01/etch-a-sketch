Etch-A-Sketch project by The Odin Project.

Simple sketch page that automatically draws when mouse is hovered over drawing grid. Colors can be changed, an eraser can be used, grid can be cleared and grid size can be changed.

future update ideas:
- draw or erase with left click instead of hover.
- a button that can turn grid lines off and on based around grid size.
- update design of the whole webpage.
